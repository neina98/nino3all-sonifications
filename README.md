MSc Dissertation: Data Sonification of Weather Patterns with a Focus on the El Niño Southern Oscillation

Abstract: This dissertation explores the use of sonification to analyse and interpret data from the Niño 3 index, aiming to deepen our understanding of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. Using a range of sonification techniques, including Audification and Parameter-Mapping Sonification, the study also employs Time-Delay Embedding and Wave Space Sonification to explore the underlying geometry of this dynamical system. The findings reveal new possibilities for capturing patterns that are not easily detected through traditional visualisations. Serving as a comprehensive comparison, this research addresses questions like how sonification can provide a fresh perspective on intricate weather patterns. This work serves as a preliminary step towards the broader application of auditory displays in climate science, suggesting new approaches for data representation and interpretation.
